		<p>NOTE: I had a whole essay on this, but my computer crashed an lost everything Q_Q: here's the sparknotes just text me for the whole thing.
		<br/><br/>
		    Justyn was Lux's combat trainer and mentor when she was young, but he put ideas about exploring the outside world in her head and quietly got fired and dismissed from the military. He stuggled to find a job until he got a job as a inventors asistant. He makes really good hextech shit, especially weapons. The pair becomes somewhat famous. He sells his weapons on the side. Quickly regrets that decicion. Decides to try adn recover the weapons by himself. Partially fails. Goes into hiding. No one knows who made the powerful hextech weapons. Refuses to make more. Years later gets a request to make one last weapon from his mentor. He grudingly accepts. Two days later his mentor is murdered with that weapon. The workshop is given to Justyn thorugh a will, and inside Justyn find his first 3 hextech weapons and a note. Deciding to find the murderer and reclaim the rest of his weapons, he builds more weaponry and sets out to kick ass. BTW: he built jinx's guns O_o, and the mentor's was the inventor ziggs worked with.
